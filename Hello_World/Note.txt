Hello My name is Ashutosh Singh.
Welcome on Github.
So let's start on github.
How to push ?
To push on git bash first add the new files by writing
i) git add <filename>
ii) Then commit by writing git commit -m <appropriate message> 
iii) Now to push write,  git remote add origin 'your url name'.
iv)Now push by command -> git push -u origin master
v) If ask for username & password then type them.
vi) And yay !!! your code is pushed to the remote repo.
